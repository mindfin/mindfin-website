                    <h3>An auto loan is a loan that person takes out in order to purchase a motor vehicle. Auto loans are typically structured as installment loans and are secured by the value of vehicle being purchased.</h3>
                    <p>Auto financing, also known as car finance, car financing or auto finance, refers to the range of financial products available that allow people to acquire a car with any arrangement other than a full-cash single lump payment (outright payment).</p>
                    <p>The provision of car finance, usually by a bank or some kind of financial institution, allows consumers to pay the dealer or manufacturer, even though they not have the money, i.e. car finance allows the consumer to buy a car by borrowing the money so that the seller can be paid.</p>
                    <p>Auto financing is widely used both by members of the public and businesses. A wide range of finance products are available. Business contract hire, which can provide tax and cash flow benefits, is very popular among companies.</p>

                        <p> Banks usually offer auto loan up to 90% of the cost for new vehicles and 85% for second hand vehicle. The vehicle is hypothecated to the lender, as collateral. The repayment is based on your monthly income and your ability to repay and the tenure is typically between 12-84 months.</p>
                        <p>Lenders fix interest rates depending on the type of vehicle and loan amount. Interest rates are usually fixed for auto loans.Loan approval process for an auto loan is relatively easier when compared to home loan.</p>

                                <p>Like all other loans, lenders look at your current credit health as well as the pattern of your past payment history. Lenders look for a CIBIL Score of 750 and above before determining the final status of your loan application. A higher CIBIL Score increases the probability of your loan approval.</p>
