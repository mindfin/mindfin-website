                    <h3>It typically involves a lender giving a business finance that is secured by a piece of equipment.  This works for those businesses that are finding it hard to get finance because the equipment is used as security and if they default on payment the equipment will be taken away</h3>
                    <p>When a lender offers monies that are secured against equipment the amount financed cannot exceed the collateral value.  The reason for this is because if the borrower defaulted as advised earlier the equipment would not cover the value of the outstanding payments due.  Another term of lending is that the length of the loan cannot also exceed the length of the economic useful life of the financed equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>Equipment finance is common for those businesses that struggle to source traditional funding.  So this option is fantastic, especially for startup companies.  It is now possible to have the equipment needed to function.

                        <p>With regards to cost it can be far more expensive in the long term.  Short term there will be lots of benefits as a lump sum of cash does not need to be paid out but over the long term the monies paid out for equipment finance will be far greater.  Each business considering equipment finance needs to identify whether this works</p>
                        <p>Most lending institutions will only agree to pay 80% – 90% of the cost, leaving you to cover the other 10% – 20%.

                        <p>In the long term, the arrangement will ultimately cost more than if you had just bought the equipment outright.
