                    <h3>A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts plus the other agreed charges.</h3>
                    <p>A perfect place to compare and apply for best credit card in India online. You can find credit cards offered by major banks along with their features, benefits, fees, and latest offers, everything at a single place. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance. Credit cards let you make high-ticket purchases on easy EMIs and make shopping more rewarding for you. Paisabazaar is the right place to find a credit card that best fits your needs and helps you make the most of your purchases.</p>
                    <p>A credit card is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month.[2] In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card also differs from a cash card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card.</p>
