          <p>A term loan is a loan from a bank for a specific amount that has a specified repayment schedule and either a fixed or floating interest rate. A term loan is often appropriate for an established small business with sound financial statements and the ability to make a substantial down payment to minimize payment amounts and the total cost of the loan.</p>
          <p>In corporate borrowing, a term loan is usually for equipment, real estate or working capital paid off between one and 25 years. Often, a small business uses the cash from a term loan to purchase fixed assets, such as equipment or a new building for its production process. Some businesses borrow the cash they need to operate from month to month. Many banks have established term-loan programs specifically to help companies in this way.</p>

            <p>Term loan is a medium-term source financed primarily by banks and financial institutions. Such a type of loan is generally used for financing of expansion, diversification and modernization of projectsâ€”so this type of financing is also known as project financing. Term loans are repayable in periodic installments.</p>

            <p>Term loan is a part of debt financing obtained from banks and financial institutions.</p>
            <p class="sub-head-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Security:</strong></p>
            <p>Term loans are secured loans. Assets which are financed through term loans serve as primary security and the other assets of the company serve as collateral security.</p>
            <p class="sub-head-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Obligation:</strong></p>
            <p>Interest payment and repayment of principal on term loans is obligatory on the part of the borrower. Whether the firm is earning a profit or not, term loans are generally repayable over a period of 5 to 10 years in installments.</p>
            <p class="sub-head-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Interest:</strong></p>
            <p>Term loans carry a fixed rate of interest but this rate is negotiated between the borrowers and lenders at the time of dispersing of loan.</p>
            <p class="sub-head-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Maturity:</strong></p>
            <p>As it is a source of medium-term financing, its maturity period lies between 5 to 10 years and repayment is made in installments.</p>
            <p class="sub-head-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Restrictive Covenants::</strong></p>
            <p>Besides asset security, the lender of the term loans imposes other restrictive covenants to themselves. Lenders ask the borrowers to maintain a minimum asset base, not to raise additional loans or to repay existing loans, etc.</p>
            <p class="sub-head-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Convertibility:</strong></p>
            <p>Term loans may be converted into equity at the option and according to the terms and conditions laid down by the financial institutions.</p>
