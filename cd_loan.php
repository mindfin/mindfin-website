                        <p>Naturally, the amount and tenure differs according to each lender and the product that you wish to purchase. The durable loan amount could range from a few thousands to a few lakhs, while the tenure could range from 8 months to 3 years. In general, you need to be between 21-60 years to apply for this type of loan and need to demonstrate proof of income. You can apply online or, in some cases, even apply at specific stores that have tie-ups with specific lenders.
                            The interest rates could range between 15-22% depending on whether you are a salaried employee or self–employed. Some lenders offer interest-free loans where the interest component is subvented and passed on to the finance company directly by the manufacture or retailer.
