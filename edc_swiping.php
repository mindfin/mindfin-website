                    <p>Cash has been the king of retail transactions in India and this was due to multiple factors like, less penetration of cashless modes of payment like debit cards, credit cards, wallets, high cost of payment acceptance modes (eg: cost of POS device), taxation worries / no incentive for going cashless.</p>

                            <p>By accepting cashless payments, the shopping experience for the buyer is seamless, quick and hassle-free. Be it a retail store or an independent service like home baking or photography or car service, impulse buys increase when you accept cashless payments, thus increasing the sales. In most cases, consumers tend to buy without any restrictions if there is an option for electronic payment. With credit cards having countless rewards these days, consumers are prone to shop more if a business accepts cashless payments. By deploying mobile cashless payment counters like card swiping machines, customers no longer have to stand in queues.</p>

                                <p>The best part of using a card swiping machine is that they are pocket friendly. One can either purchase the device upfront or opt for friendly rental plans.This is comparatively a lower expense than the one spent on managing cash payments. If your business model entails collecting cash after the service/product is delivered then you must be aware of the risk of handling the cash like counterfeits, pilferages, as well as the need to do multiple security checks of personnel handling such cash. With completely transparent pricing, mobile payment solutions like Bijlipay allow one to rent or purchase mPOS for their businesses easily. The maintenance of these mPOS devices cost less than that of traditional bulky POS devices.</p>

                                            The current business environment is dynamic and competitive. We are already seeing a great adoption in cashless payments with volume of transactions on POS terminals in India zooming 43% YoY. Based on RBI’s Payments Vision document release recently, we can soon expect a big policy boost to cashless payments. Therefore, it’s imperative that retail merchants quickly adapt to new age payment solutions like mPOS and increase their business potential exponentially.

Cashless payment protects your businesses’ revenue streams, thus reducing frauds. By using electronic payments, you also eliminate the expenses and security risks that are associated with physically transporting cash. As every transaction is recorded proficiently, it saves the money, time and human power used in accounting the sales. Your revenue and cash flow can also be viewed in real time. Another advantage of cashless payments is that, taxes that need to be paid to and by your businesses can be easily computed with no error.
