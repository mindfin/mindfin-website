                    <!--<p>A car purchase, whether the first one or an upgrade from an earlier one, requires a sizeable portion of your savings. But instead of taking out money from a savings account you can go for a car loan, thereby keeping your savings in place for emergencies. Applying for a car loan in Bangalore or any Indian city is just a 2-minute process, if not less. The Interest Rates for car loans in Bangalore are not too high either, starting at 9.35%. However, your EMI, the actual money you will pay month-on-month will depend on your loan tenure. For instance, if you take a 4-year tenure for a Rs 5 lakh loan, your EMI will be Rs 12,525 (@ 9.35%) and total interest amount payable will be close to Rs 1 lakh. However, notice how your interest payout will change if the loan tenure is altered. If we use the same amount and interest rate but tenure as 5 years, your EMI will be Rs 10, 464 and total interest amount close to Rs 1.3 lakhs. Thus, loan tenure plays a crucial role in determining your EMI and total interest payout.</p>-->
                    <p>Owning a car is a style statement these days and every second person belonging to the urban population feels that having a car of their choice is now a necessity.
                        In accordance to this growing need, Indian banks have been competing with each other to provide the best car loans at the most affordable cost with a whole bundle of benefits.
                        Car dealers have been teaming up with insurance companies to provide package car deals as this is the much selected option amongst the young population.
                        Owning a car in Bangalore is not a great hassle. Select the model of the car, get the quote from a dealer, apply for a car loan and buy the car of your choice. Simple!</p>

                    <!--<p>One of the easiest ways to buy a car is taking out a car loan. It basically halves your worry so that you can focus on the car you want. Some of the benefits of a car loan are:</p>-->
                    <p>With the host of these wonderful features and advantages that accompany a car loan it is certainly a preferred route for owning a four wheeler.</p>
                    <ul>
                        
                        <li>Wider Eligibility: Due to the increased competition among the financiers the customers have benefited in terms of greater coverage of population under the current eligibility criteria.</li>
                        <li>Simplified Procedure: The prevailing procedures for availing car loan have been greatly simplified in order to woo more number of people into taking the car loan.</li>
                        
                        <li>Customized EMIs: The financiers today allow the borrower to customize the EMI as per the repayment capacity.</li>
                        <li>Dealer Benefits:  The financiers through tie ups  can provide the buyer a great deal through discounts on the price and freebies including accessories, insurance and registration charges. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 class="sub-head-secondary" style="font-size: 20px;"><b><u>Bangalore and Car loans</u></b></h6>
                    <p>Almost every bank offers car loan in Bangalore. For example, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and many more. However, do a thorough homework before applying for car loan, as with any other loan. First, know what loan value is manageable for you to repay. Next, compare all the offers available to you. And finally, apply for the loan that best fits your requirement and pocket.</p>
                    <p>Interest Rates for car loans in Bangalore also depend on the loan tenure chosen. Longer loan tenure means lower EMIs but higher total interest outflow. On the other hand, shorter tenure means higher EMIs but lower total interest amount. In any case, do ensure, you pay your EMIs timely in order to avoid any negative impact on your credit score.</p>
