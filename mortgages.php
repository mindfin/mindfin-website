                    <h3>Your mortgage is probably the largest financial transaction and commitment you are likely to undertake. We offer you mortgage advice which is totally unbiased and individually tailored to your needs and requirements. </h3>
                    <p>Gone are the days when a borrower was grateful to the lender for providing them with a mortgage facility. In today's marketplace, lenders are in competition with each other for your valuable business. They are therefore willing to offer incentives to entice you. </p>
                    <p>There are so many types of mortgage available that it is easy to become confused, possibly opting for the product offering the lowest headline rate of interest. However, when booking and arrangement fees, conditional insurances, higher lending charges, lock-ins and early repayment charges are taken into account, the products may not be as attractive as you might have first thought. </p>
                    <p> We are not tied to any particular lender, which means that we have the ability to act on your behalf, representing your best interests, in order to establish the most appropriate mortgage solution for you. </p>
                    <p>Please complete our Apply Loan Form (it is essential that you provide truthful and up to date information); one of our mortgage experts will then contact you to discuss your enquiry; we will search the mortgage market of selected lenders, some of which offer exclusive products to brokers such as ourselves to determine which lender will offer you the most attractive mortgage options, suited to your particular requirements; we will then make a specific recommendation based on our discussions with you, answer any queries you may have and provide you with any further information you may require. We will lastly help you through the application process, take you through to a formal mortgage offer from the lender and, ultimately, to the completion of your new mortgage. </p>

                        <p>The ‘standard’ term for a new mortgage is 25 years, but you can choose a different term to suit your circumstances. With a repayment mortgage the longer the term, the lower the monthly payments, although you will pay more in total. Beware of making financial commitments that continue past your retirement age unless you’re sure you’ll be able to afford the payments. </p>

                    <div class="col-sm-9">
                        <p>You should always review your mortgage whenever the period of a special deal - for example, a fixed or discounted interest rate - comes to an end, as well as annually when your lender sends you a statement. This is a good opportunity to check your mortgage and consider any changes. Gone are the days when you took out a mortgage and kept the same one for 25 years. Nowadays, it’s common to shop around every few years to make sure you are getting a good deal. Switching can cut your monthly payments but you’ll need to weigh up these monthly savings or other benefits against the up-front costs of making the switch.</p>

                        <p>The Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee Premium is a payment often demanded by a lender in order for them to lend. This is particularly the case where the lender is lending a high loan to value (LTV) usually 90-100% but in some cases can be charged at a lower LTV such as 80%. It protects the lender from problems should you default on the loan and be repossessed. The insurer will settle with the lender and then turn back to you for the shortfall. The premium varies from lender to lender but in the majority of cases the premium must be paid by you, the borrower, although sometimes this can be added to the loan. </p>
