                        <p>The loan is generally repaid by equated monthly installments, using post-dated cheques. Banks usually ask for 12, 24 or 36 PDCs, after which you need to repeat the process until you have repaid the loan. Some banks may also insist on a cheque for an amount equivalent to the loan outstanding at the end of PDC period to ensure timely replenishment of PDCs for the next 12, 24 or 36 months as the case may be.
                            <br>In case your installments are to be deducted against your salary, you need a letter from your employer accepting this arrangement and directly remitting the amount to the bank every month. This is possible only if your organization has an arrangement with the bank for all employees.
                            <br>Some banks allow you to give standing instructions to the bank where you have your savings/current account to deduct money each month crediting your home loan account.
                            <br>Some banks allow the monthly installments to be paid by convenient ECS facility.
                            Another possible mode of payment is by cash or demand draft (not all banks offer this). You can deposit the EMI every month at the bank’s office.</p>
