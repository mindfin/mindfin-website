                    <p>Discounting of Letter of Credit (LC) is a short-term credit facility provided by the bank. In the Letter of Credit discounting process, the bank purchases the documents or bills of the exporter and in return make him the payment for a security or a fee. LC discounting is actually a term used for ease in place of ‘LC Bill Discounting’, which means discounting of a bill backed by LC. </p>
                    <p>We live in an era where trade is not restricted to national boundaries, we trade internationally. Global trading though sounds good but brings a lot of difficulties like overseas distances, trust between the parties, unstable economic environment, nature of transactions, different trade laws of each country, etc. So to eliminate such difficulties and to assure the seller about the recovery of money, Letter of Credit Discounting came into existence. It acts as a financial security in international trade.</p>
